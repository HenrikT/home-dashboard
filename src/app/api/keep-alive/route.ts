/**
 * Keep-Alive API Endpoint
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Supabase free-tier projects are paused automatically after 7 days of inactivity.
 * To prevent this, we schedule a daily Vercel Cron job to "ping" Supabase.
 *
 * How:
 * This endpoint is called by the Vercel Cron job once per day.
 * It performs a simple SELECT query on the "keep_alive" table.
 * This ensures there is regular database activity to keep the project "active".
 *
 * Security:
 * No authentication is required â€” this endpoint is public.
 * The query does NOT expose or return any sensitive data.
 * Only basic metadata is returned for verification.
 *
 * Response:
 * - 200 OK if the query succeeds
 * - 500 if an error occurs
 */
